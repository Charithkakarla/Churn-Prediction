EMPLOYEE CHURN ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Employee churn is a critical metric affecting organizational performance, productivity, and costs. This document provides insights based on historical data analysis and predictive modeling.

KEY FINDINGS

1. CHURN RATE BY DEPARTMENT
- Sales: 28% annual churn rate (highest)
- Operations: 22% annual churn rate
- Marketing: 18% annual churn rate
- Engineering: 15% annual churn rate
- HR: 12% annual churn rate (lowest)

Sales department shows highest turnover due to high-pressure targets and competitive job market.

2. TENURE PATTERNS
- 0-6 months: 35% churn (onboarding critical period)
- 6-12 months: 25% churn
- 12-24 months: 20% churn
- 24-36 months: 12% churn
- 36+ months: 8% churn (stable employees)

First year is critical for retention. Employees who stay beyond 24 months are significantly more likely to remain long-term.

3. SATISFACTION LEVEL CORRELATION
- Satisfaction < 0.4: 85% churn probability
- Satisfaction 0.4-0.6: 60% churn probability
- Satisfaction 0.6-0.8: 25% churn probability
- Satisfaction > 0.8: 8% churn probability

Satisfaction level is the strongest predictor of churn.

4. PERFORMANCE PARADOX
Interestingly, both low and very high performers show elevated churn:
- Low performers (score < 3.0): 45% churn (performance issues)
- Average performers (3.0-4.0): 18% churn
- High performers (4.0-4.5): 15% churn
- Top performers (> 4.5): 28% churn (recruited by competitors)

Top performers need special retention strategies including competitive compensation and growth opportunities.

5. WORKLOAD IMPACT
- < 140 hours/month: 30% churn (underutilized)
- 140-170 hours/month: 15% churn (optimal)
- 170-200 hours/month: 35% churn (overworked)
- > 200 hours/month: 55% churn (burnout risk)

Extreme workloads (too low or too high) correlate with increased churn.

6. PROMOTION EFFECT
- No promotion in 5 years: 40% churn
- Promoted in last 5 years: 12% churn

Career stagnation is a major churn driver.

7. SALARY LEVEL IMPACT
- Low salary band: 35% churn
- Medium salary band: 22% churn
- High salary band: 10% churn

Competitive compensation significantly reduces churn risk.

8. PROJECT LOAD
- 1-2 projects: 28% churn (underutilized)
- 3-4 projects: 15% churn (optimal)
- 5-6 projects: 25% churn (stretched)
- 7+ projects: 42% churn (overwhelmed)

Balanced project allocation is crucial.

9. WORK ACCIDENTS
Employees with work accidents show 18% higher churn rate, possibly due to:
- Safety concerns
- Injury-related stress
- Workplace environment dissatisfaction

10. COST OF CHURN
Average cost per employee departure:
- Recruitment costs: $4,000
- Training costs: $6,000
- Productivity loss: $15,000
- Knowledge loss: $8,000
Total: ~$33,000 per employee

For high-skilled roles (Engineering, Senior positions), costs can exceed $50,000.
